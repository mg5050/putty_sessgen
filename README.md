#### Populate PuTTY session list automatically

PuTTY session auto-gen is a program created for IT professionals who frequently connect to different devices via SSH using PuTTY. PSA saves time by parsing host name and IP en masse via a flat text file. All sessions and settings are automatically populated within PuTTY and log files are stored at the appropriate path. These presets can be changed in settings.reg. The user also has the option to clear all saved sessions.
